## WingCodeEdit

A Lightweight Qt-based code and text editor widget for Qt6. This widget comes from [qtextpad](https://github.com/zrax/qtextpad) and I make some improvements such as newer intergrated syntax highlighting which powers [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/), code completing and symbol mark.

> This project is used for scripting with [WingHexExplorer2](https://github.com/Wing-summer/WingHexExplorer2) in version 2.2.1 newer or later.

## Features
